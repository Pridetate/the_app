Hi Assesor, thank you for the educative assessment.

Below is a brief description of how i developed the app

1. I used React with Typescript for this project (to remove typo errors)
2. Material ui was this css framework that I used for this app
3. Header:

- A single header was used to develop both the main and search bars

4. The app was interesting to develop and it took me about 4 hrs.
5. We could improve the app by having other figma design for smaller devices.
